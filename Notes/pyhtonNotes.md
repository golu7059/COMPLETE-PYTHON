## What is Python?

__*ython is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python emphasizes code readability and simplicity, making it an excellent language for beginners and experienced developers*__

 1. `Simple and Easy to Learn:` 
 2. `Interpreted`: Python is an interpreted language, which means that the Python code is executed line by line. This makes it easy to test and debug code.
 3. `High-Level`: Python is a high-level language, which means that it abstracts away low-level details like memory management and hardware interaction. This makes it easier to write and understand code.
 4. `Dynamic Typing`: Python is dynamically typed, which means that you donâ€™t need to declare the data type of a variable explicitly. Python will automatically infer the data type based on the value assigned to the variable.
 4. `Strong Typing`: Python is strongly typed, which means that the data type of a variable is enforced at runtime. This helps prevent errors and makes the code more robust.
 6. `Extensive Standard Library`: Python comes with a large standard library that provides tools and modules for various tasks, such as file I/O, networking, and more. This makes it easy to build complex applications without having to write everything from scratch.
 7. `Cross-Platform`: Python is a cross-platform language, which means that Python code can run on different operating systems without modification. This makes it easy to develop and deploy Python applications on different platforms.
 8. `Community and Ecosystem`: Python has a large and active community, which contributes to its ecosystem. There are many third-party libraries and frameworks available for various purposes, making Python a versatile language for many applications.
 9. `Versatile`: Python is a versatile language that can be used for various purposes, including web development, data science, artificial intelligence, game development, and more.
